<div id="about">
    <p><em>Pool</em>, also more formally known as <em>pocket billiards</em> (mostly in North America) or <em>pool billiards</em> (mostly in Europe and Australia), is the family of cue sports and games played on a pool table having six receptacles called pockets along the rails, into which balls are deposited as the main goal of play. Popular versions include eight-ball and nine-ball. An obsolete term for pool is <em>six-pocket</em>.</p>
    <p>There are hundreds of pool games. Some of the more well known include:</p>

        <li><a href="#nine_ball">nine-ball</a></li>
        <li>ten-ball</li>
        <li>straight pool</li>
        <li><a href="#one_pocket">one-pocket</a></li>
        <li><a href="#bank_pool">bank pool</a></li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Note: </em>There are also hybrid games combining aspects of both pool and carom billiards, such as American four-ball billiards, cowboy pool and bottle pool.</p>
