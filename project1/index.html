<div id="about">
    <p><em>Pool</em>, also more formally known as <em>pocket billiards</em> (mostly in North America) or <em>pool billiards</em> (mostly in Europe and Australia), is the family of cue sports and games played on a pool table having six receptacles called pockets along the rails, into which balls are deposited as the main goal of play. Popular versions include eight-ball and nine-ball. An obsolete term for pool is <em>six-pocket</em>.</p>
    <p>There are hundreds of pool games. Some of the more well known include:</p>

        <li><a href="#nine_ball">nine-ball</a></li>
        <li>ten-ball</li>

    </ol>
    <p><em>Note: </em>There are also hybrid games combining aspects of both pool and carom billiards, such as American four-ball billiards, cowboy pool and bottle pool.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <blockquote><p>The Oxford English dictionary states that pool is generally "any of various types of billiards for two or more players" but goes on to note that the first specific meaning of "a game in which each player uses a cue ball of a distinctive colour to pocket the balls of the other player(s) in a certain order, the winner taking all the stakes submitted at the start of the contest" is now obsolete and its other specific definitions are all for games that originate in the United States of America.</p></blockquote>
    <p>In the United States, though the original "pool" game was played on a pocketless carom billiards table, the term later stuck to all new games of pocket billiards as the sport gained in popularity, and so outside the cue sports industry, which has long favored the more formal term pocket billiards, pool has remained the common name for the sport.</p>

    <h2>Equipment</h2>
    <p>Pool or pocket billiards (as the sport's governing body calls it) is played on a six pocket table. Modern pool tables generally range in size from 3.5 feet (1.07 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr>) by 7 feet (2.13 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr>), to 4.5 feet (1.37 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr>) by 9 feet (2.74 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr>).</p>
    <p>The balls range from 2.25 inches (57.15 <abbr title="millimeters">mm</abbr>) in diameter to 2.375 inches (60.33 <abbr title="millimeters">mm</abbr>) in diameter. Under the <abbr title="World Pool-Billiard Association">WPA</abbr>/<abbr title="Billiard Congress of America">BCA</abbr> (see below) equipment specifications, the weight may be from 5.5 to 6 <abbr title="ounces">oz.</abbr> (156â€“170 <abbr title="grams">g</abbr>) with a diameter of 2.25 <abbr title="inches">in.</abbr> (57.15 <abbr title="millimeters">mm</abbr>), plus or minus 0.005 <abbr title="inches">in.</abbr> (0.127 <abbr title="millimeters">mm</abbr>). Modern coin-operated pool tables generally use one of three methods to distinguish and return the cue ball to the front of the table while the numbered balls return to an inaccessible receptacle until paid for again: the cue ball is larger and heavier than the other balls, or denser and heavier, or has a magnetic core.</p>
    <p>Modern cue sticks are generally 58.5 inches (148.6 <abbr title="centimeters">cm</abbr>) long for pool while cues prior to 1980 were designed for straight pool and had an average length of 57.5 inches (146.1 <abbr title="centimeters">cm</abbr>). By comparison, carom billiards cues are generally shorter with larger tips, and snooker cues longer with smaller tips.</p>
